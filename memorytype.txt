hello world !!
in this text file you will get to know about the memory type and there management in a os
so the type of memories are 

1. RAM : volatile memory
2. Persistent : non volatile memory SSD

1. RAM is totally divided into 3 parts 
a. stack b. heap c. static 

** static memory 
here the binary of the programs and jo bhi global variables and static variable are stored 
also this memory is alive till the program ends cause the variables can be used at any point of time in the program 
so this memory keeps the varibles safely 

** stack
here all the function arguments local variables are stored jo ki at the time of main fun run chalenge in the manner of last 
in first out also it will remain jab tak function alive hai and get released when the function ends and this is very low 
storage and just can store primitive datatype only which requires very less memory space

** heap
the datatype which store or take a large space are called during program runtime are stored in heap memory it is large memory 
space which can store a large space of data such as vector and string which are dynamic datatype 
also whenever the heap stores a datatype in the heap memory creates a particular address of that datatype and 
stores the data address in the stack and call the address whenever it is required by the stack memory and get released after use
of that data from heap too
makes the memory space more clear for the program 

2. SSD 
non volatile memory jus stores the raw data which is permanent to be stored and accessed
